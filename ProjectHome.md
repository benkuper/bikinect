BiKinect is a tool suite made to help developers & artists work with the kinect in the easiest way possible.

BiKinect is based on the last OpenNI driver.
Microsoft Research SDK support is planned.

**A simple page has been created in the wiki to explain the main concept of mappInect. Feel free to checkout.**

**A troubleshooting page has been created to resolve simple installation issues**

**_New Ableton Live project available, see description of the file for instructions_**

Softwares included :

> - MappInect : Modular Mapper which allows XML driven live mapping values from the Kinect, from simple mappings with a one-to-one value relationship to complex schemes with filters, conditionnal processors, multiple value relationships, triggers, timers, sequencers and a lot of other fun stuffs to play with. The values can be sent to MIDI, OSC and DMX.
